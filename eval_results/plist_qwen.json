So I need to find battles where no ship with tonnage 225 was lost in that battle.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships between the tables. The ship table has a 'lost_in_battle' column which references the battle's id. So each ship that was lost in a battle is linked to that battle. The tonnage of the ship is in the ship table. \n\nSo the plan is: find all battles where there is no entry in the ship table for that battle with tonnage '225'. Wait, but how to approach this? Maybe first find all battles that have a ship with tonnage '225' lost in them, and then count the total battles minus those. Or use a NOT EXISTS clause.\n\nLet me think.

So I need to find all the cartoons where Written_by is Todd Casey. Then, find the channels that are airing those cartoons, and then get the countries from the TV_Channel table that are associated with those channels. But the question is about countries that are *not* playing those cartoons. Wait, no. Wait, the question is phrased as \"countries that are not playing cartoons written by Todd Casey\". So, the countries that do not have any of their channels airing cartoons written by Todd Casey.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the approach is to first find all the countries that *do* play such cartoons, and then exclude them from the list of all countries.
